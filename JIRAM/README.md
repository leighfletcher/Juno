Repository for mapped JIRAM M-band (5 micron) observations.

`JIRAM_NEB` contains both EPS images and FITS files for PJ4, PJ7 and PJ8, which
were compared to MWR observations of the NEB hot spots and plumes.  JIRAM maps
were generated from observations acquired from the PDS
(https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/JUNO). 
JIRAM data are in W/m2/sr/micron.  Both System I and System III maps are
provided.
