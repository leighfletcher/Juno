# Juno Processed Data

Repository for processed Juno data pertinent to publications by Fletcher et al. 
Please note that the repository for raw and calibrated Juno observations is the
[PDS Atmospheres
Node](https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data\_and\_services/atmospheres\_data/JUNO),
but that some degree of processing is typically applied to prepare figures for
journal articles.  This repository contains the processed data.

* `JunoCam`:  Contains cylindrical projections of JunoCam images (PJ3-9) by
Gerald Eichstadt, as well as latitude/longitude labelled images of the
equatorial region for Fletcher et al. (2020).

* `JIRAM`:  Contains cylidrically projected versions of JIRAM M-band
observations, focussing on the equatorial region for PJ4, 7 and 8 as described
in Fletcher et al. (2020).

* `MWR`:  Contains microwave radiometer observations in two formats -
latitudinally-averaged nadir brightness temperatures from PJ3-9 (described by
Oyafuso et al. 2020), and projected nadir-equivalent brightness temperature maps
for the 30N to 30S range (described by Zhang et al., 2020).  Both of these data
types were presented in Fletcher et al. (2020).
