## Nadir-Equivalent Brightness Temperature Maps

Microwave Radiometer observations from PJ3 (December 2016) to PJ9 (October
2017).  This is a processed data product, using the observed limb-darkening over
multiple perijoves to generate nadir-equivalent brightness temperature maps with
the limb-dependence removed.  The user should note, however, that there remains
some degeneracy between limb effects and longitudinal structure in the measured
brightness (see Zhang et al., 2020).

Each map is provided as an EPS file, a TIFF file, and as an IDL "save" file for
the region between 30N and 30S (planetocentric latitudes), as displayed by
Fletcher et al. (2020).  The format of the IDL files is three arrays - MLAT (planetocentric latitudes), MLON (System III
West Longitudes), and TACORR (the brightness temperatures).  These are provided
for channels 1 (50cm) to 6 (1.37cm).
