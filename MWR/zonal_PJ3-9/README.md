Zonal-mean nadir brightness temperatures were extracted from MWR limb-darkening
coefficients between 20N and 20S.  These are provided as an IDL "save" file with
the following format:

* LATTB           FLOAT     = Array[6, 7, 65] - Planetocentric latitude.

* NADIRTB         FLOAT     = Array[6, 7, 65] - nadir brightness in K.

There are 6 channels, 7 perijoves (PJ3-PJ9), and 65 latitudes for each.  These
were plotted as Fig. 1 of Fletcher et al. (2020).
